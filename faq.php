    <h2>Rules and Regs</h2>
    
    <div class="faqItem">
      <a href="#moving" name="moving" class="faqQuestion deep-anchor lead">What are the procedures for moving?</a>
      <div class="faqAnswer">
        <p>Moving in and out of units requires that the owner of the unit provide notice to Market Street Management at least 24 hours in advance of the move.<br> 
          Every move into the building <strong>requires a $200 move-in fee</strong>, which will be billed to the unit owner.  Once notification of a move is received, the management company will place padding in the freight elevator and provide you with a way to stop the elevator to make your move easier.<br>  
          All moves must be done using the back alley entrances, rather than the front doors.  Please help us keep up appearances by not hauling goods through the front entryways.
