    <h1>About the HOA</h1>
    <p>The Swallow Hill Condominium Association, Inc. was incorporated in 2002 and is governed by a board that consists of 5 members, each serving 2 year terms.  The terms of service are offset so that no more than three board members are up for re-election in any given year.  This provides continuity from year to year and helps to ensure unbroken support for the Swallow Hill condominium community.</p>
